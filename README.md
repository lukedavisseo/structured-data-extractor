# STRUDEX (A STRUctured Data EXtractor)

I suck at writing readme docs so this will improve in the future but for now, this is what I have.

This Python script extracts structured data from web pages and exports them to CSV.

Can Screaming Frog and probably some other tools do this? **Yes**.

Can I do this in Screaming Frog? **No, and that's why I made it because somehow coding this in Python was easier for me!**

This has been tested by precisely one (1) person other than me and seemed to work but I expect bugs so please let me know if you encounter any and I can fix them.
