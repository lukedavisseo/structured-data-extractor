# STRUDEX (A STRUctured Data EXtractor)

I suck at writing readme docs so this will improve in the future but for now, this is what I have.

This Python script extracts structured data from web pages and exports them to CSV.

## Instructions

1. Enter your list of URLs, one per line
2. Click Submit to run the script
3. Depending on the size of your URL list, you could let it run in the background and carry on with other work, make a cup of tea/coffee, or look up Simpsons memes or make your own on Reddit. Wait, that's just me!
4. Once it's done, you'll be presented with a download button to save your data as a CSV

## What you get

In the CSV, you get two columns: one for the URLs and one for the found structured data (raw and not pretty printed).

## Screenshots

## FAQ

Can Screaming Frog and probably some other tools do this? **Yes**.

Can I do this in Screaming Frog? **No, and that's why I made it because somehow coding this in Python was easier for me!**

This has been tested by precisely one (1) person other than me and seemed to work but I expect bugs so please let me know if you encounter any and I can fix them.
